# Mastering Ollie Variations in Street Skating

Welcome back to Street Spins Weekly, where we spin the wheels on all things street skating! In this fourth installment of our technique series, we're zooming in on the ollie – the gateway trick that every skater dreams of nailing. But let's level up: we're talking variations that turn a basic pop into a street symphony.

## The Ollie Basics: A Quick Refresher

Invented by Alan "Ollie" Gelfand in the late 1970s, the ollie revolutionized skateboarding by allowing riders to leap over obstacles without grabbing the board. It's simple in theory: slide your foot back to snap the tail, level the board mid-air with your front foot, and land smoothly. But on the streets? That's where the magic – and the mayhem – happens.

## Street-Specific Variations

Urban environments demand adaptability. Here's how to evolve your ollie for the concrete jungle:

- **The Nollie Ollie**: Pop from the nose instead of the tail. Perfect for fakie approaches to ledges. Pro tip: Keep your weight centered to avoid nose-diving into that pothole.

- **Big Ollie**: Amp up the height for clearing benches or hydrants. Focus on explosive leg power – think of it as a squat jump with a board attached.

- **Ollie North**: Slide your front foot higher up the board for more airtime. Rodney Mullen's signature move shines in tight spots like manual pads.

Imagine ollieing over a row of shopping carts in a bustling city park – that's the thrill of street skating!

## Tips from the Pros

We caught up with street legend Chris Haslam, who shared: "Practice on flat ground first, then hit the streets. Visualize the obstacle; hesitation is your worst enemy." Start slow, film your sessions, and analyze what goes wrong. Safety gear? Non-negotiable, especially with those unexpected curbs.

## Why It Matters

Mastering ollie variations isn't just about showing off; it's about flow and creativity in skate spots worldwide. From Tokyo's narrow alleys to LA's iconic stairs, these tricks keep street culture alive.
